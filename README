To Run:
------
Execute the file test.py as python test.py 
Alternatively, use python testing framwork (i.e. use py.test test.py) to run the tests


Files:
-----
vertex.py     ==> contains point data type and vertex data type that contains point
edge.py       ==> edge data type, that contains vertices and other relevant edge information
jsonparse.py  ==> json parser that assumes the format given in the web page. 
stock.py      ==> this contains all the functions that are needed to work on a given stock to output material cost
test.py       ==> contains all testing


TODO:
----
A lot more defensive coding needs to be done ...

Bounding box calculations must be made primitives and need to make code more readble and modular

More tests need to be added ...!!

Port to C++ for speed ..
