To Run:
------
Execute the file test.py as python test.py 
Alternatively, use python testing framework (i.e. use py.test test.py) to run the tests
The main function tht calculates cost is in file stock.py and is called process(jsonfile)

Files:
-----
vertex.py     ==> contains point data type and vertex data type that contains point
edge.py       ==> edge data type, that contains vertices and other relevant edge information
jsonparse.py  ==> json parser that assumes the format given in the web page. 
stock.py      ==> this contains all the functions that are needed to work on a given stock to output material cost
test.py       ==> contains all testing
*.json        ==> json inputs used for testing


TODO:
----
A lot more defensive coding needs to be done ...
Add comments for readability and contract
Bounding box calculations must be made primitives
Add more testing
Port to C++ for speed
